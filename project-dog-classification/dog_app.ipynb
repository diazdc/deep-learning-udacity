If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

    "Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n",
